## Review questions

### 1. Does this fix/feature change existing behavior, or is it additive?

### 2. What is the performance impact — positive or negative?

### 3. What bugs or issues could we be missing here?

### 4. What else was fixed/implemented here that may not be obvious or properly documented?

### 5. Will this functionality/fix work on iPhone Safari or the comparable constrained supported runtime?

### 6. Does this alter any existing, adjacent behavior sharing the same component, event surface, API, state, persistence layer, or execution path?

### 7. If this ships in a shared package/library/service, what is the downstream blast radius?

| Consumer | Uses touched surface? | Effect | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | Inert / additive / behavior-changing | |

## Known limitations / follow-ups

<!-- Time bombs, deliberately deferred root-class fixes, rollout coordination, or unverified areas. -->
